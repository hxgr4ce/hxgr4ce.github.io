# hxgr4ce.github.io

This site is made almost completely from scratch in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It showcases projects I've done in my computer graphics class and links to other projects I've done throughout undergrad. View site <a href="https://hxgr4ce.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. Intended to be viewed on desktop.
